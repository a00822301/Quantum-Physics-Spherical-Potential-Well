# Quantum-Physics-Spherical-Potential-Well
This project consists in obtaining the eigenvalues of the spherical well in order to get an expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions.
These are composed of a product of the spherical harmonics and the spherical bessel function, along with a normalization constant. 
The report is in spanish, but is neatly organized and walks the reader through the process. 
I am the sole writer of the code, but the report was written in a team, and some help was given by fellow classmates.
